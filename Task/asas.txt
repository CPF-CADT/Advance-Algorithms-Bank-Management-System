Precision: Absolute units allow for precise control over the dimensions of elements, which is critical in certain design contexts where exact measurements are necessary.
Consistency: Using absolute units ensures that elements appear the same across different devices and resolutions, providing a uniform experience.
Simplicity: For designers familiar with fixed layouts, working with absolute units can simplify the design process, as they do not have to account for responsive adjustments.
